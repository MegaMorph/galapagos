; NAME:
;    RESISTANT_Mean  
;
; PURPOSE:
;    Outlier-resistant determination of the mean and standard deviation. 
; 
; EXPLANATION:
;    RESISTANT_Mean trims away outliers using the median and the median 
;    absolute deviation.    An approximation formula is used to correct for
;    the trunction caused by trimming away outliers
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;    RESISTANT_Mean, VECTOR, Sigma_CUT, Mean, Sigma_Mean, Num_RejECTED
;
; INPUT ARGUMENT:
;       VECTOR    = Vector to average
;       Sigma_CUT = Data more than this number of standard deviations from the
;               median is ignored. Suggested values: 2.0 and up.
;
; OUTPUT ARGUMENT:
;       Mean  = the mean of the input vector, numeric scalar
; OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
;	Sigma_Mean = the approximate standard deviation of the mean, numeric 
;            scalar.  This is the Sigma of the distribution divided by sqrt(N-1)
;            where N is the number of unrejected points. The larger
;            SIGMA_CUT, the more accurate. It will tend to underestimate the 
;            true uncertainty of the mean, and this may become significant for 
;            cuts of 2.0 or less. 
;       Num_RejECTED = the number of points trimmed, integer scalar
;
; EXAMPLE:
;       IDL> a = randomn(seed, 10000)    ;Normal distribution with 10000 pts
;       IDL> RESISTANT_Mean,a, 3, mean, meansig, num    ;3 Sigma clipping    
;       IDL> print, mean, meansig,num
; 
;       The mean should be near 0, and meansig should be near 0.01 ( =
;        1/sqrt(10000) ).     
; PROCEDURES USED:
;       AVG() - compute simple mean
; REVISION HISTORY:
;       Written, H. Freudenreich, STX, 1989; Second iteration added 5/91.
;       Use MEDIAN(/EVEN)    W. Landsman   April 2002
;       Correct conditional test, higher order truncation correction formula
;                R. Arendt/W. Landsman   June 2002
;       New truncation formula for sigma H. Freudenriech  July 2002
