!!  SETUP  !!
*******************************************
EXAMPLE.SETUP is the main file.
It largely follows the setup file of the original (single-band) galapagos, but galapagos-2 is NOT fully backwards compatible, 
although some features might still work on single-band data.
The original setup is explained in detail on the Galapagos website ( http://astro-staff.uibk.ac.at/~m.barden/galapagos/ ) 
and in Barden et al 2012

*******************************************
New features, parameters and input changes:
*******************************************
#===========NEW FEATURES IN THE CODE===========
- Galapagos can now use multi-band data simultaneously
- Galapagos can now do Bulge-Disk decomposition
- Galapagos can now deal with more than one PSF for an entire survey, making it more usable for ground-based surveys
- Galapagos can now use CPU time more efficiently. The code itself is slightly quicker, but especially the queuing system is new and more effective
- Some parameters (e.g. more constraints) are now user inputs, instead of being hard-wired into the code
- Many other, small changes, mostly for cleaning up the code, increases efficiency, computation speed-up

#===========MOST IMPORTANT TIPS AS THEY CAUSE THE MOST PROBLEMS===========
1) Make sure that the galapagos folder where all the code files are is in your IDL path and relatively at the start of it.
   Some procedures (e.g. mrd_struct.pro) have changed in the astrolabe and even within IDL.
   Galapagos requires particular versions of all files (e.g. because it uses additional parameters that don’t exist in all versions),
   so please make sure your IDL uses the files provided in all cases. THESE are the tested procedures and using other ones can and 
   will cause problems

2) Make sure your images are calibrated correctly! Galfit, when creating an internal sigma map for the fitting, required images to be 
   in COUNTS, not counts/sec! When using your own sigma map, this is not important, but Galapagos does not (yet) allow this.
3) Please read http://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/peng/work/galfit/TOP10.html  for top 10 tips for galfit, most of which are also true 
   for Galapagos, e.g. image calibration,…


#===========FILE LOCATIONS===========
A00) /path/to/images.gala                  #file containing ALL input files, including SExtractor (1st line) and all bands, weight,...)

FILE FORMAT HAS CHANGED DUE TO MULTI_BAND CAPABILITIES!
old format works only for single band fits.
For multi-band fits, several more files are required:
- images.gala
- images_[sex,r,u,g,i,z]

images.gala
  in one band surveys, this is the same as in original galapagos
  in multi-band surveys, this has a different format
  format: 	#folder_pre(name) #effective_wavelength #mag_offset("SED") #/path/to/images_[].gala #ZP #EXPTIME

  example:
	sex  6231    0.00 /path_to/sex.gala   30.0  1.0
	i    7625   -0.60 /path_to/i.gala     30.0  1.0
	u    3543    1.16 /path_to/u.gala     30.0  1.0
	[…]

  explanation:

  	  'folder_pre' are used for naming files and folder
    	  	      - each band gets its own folder for postage stamps
		      - masks and other files follow this naming convention
		      - the output parameters in the galfitm output follow this naming convention
	  'wavelength' is the 'wavelength' passed over to galfitm for use of Chebishev parameters (any units)
		      - I use ‘effective wavelength’ of the filters, as provided by the surveys.                      
	  	      - the 'sex' value will not be used anywhere in the code (I set it to 0.00 anyway in the example)
	  	      - does not necessarily have to be wavelength, log(wavelength) might work as well. Your call!
	  	      - please see Haeussler 2013 for details
          'mag_offset' defines how galapagos-2 transfers the 'sex' magnitudes from the source extraction step into starting 
	        values for each band. SExtractor only produces one catalogue, but starting values are required for each band. Therefore
                a correction from the SExtractor value and the starting value need to be estimated. 
	  	      - again, the SExtractor value will not be used anywhere
		      - e.g. a MEDIAN/MEAN SED can be used to derive these numbers
		      - I defined my values by running SExtractor on images of all bands, correlating them and defining 
			the median colours in respect to the combined image/image used for source extraction) of the 
                        brightest objects between the sex and the [band] image)
          '/path/to/images_[].gala'    
                      - input file, where all images for that band are designed
                      - images_[].gala themselves hold the paths to the images (tiles of images) and weight images: 
                       /path/to/science_tile1_1 /path/to/wht_tile1_1 output_directory_to_be_created object_file_preposition
			[..tile1_2]
          'zeropoint' defines the magnitude zeropoint
	  'exposure_time' defines the exposure time
	  		  

	  As ‘zero point’ and ‘exposure_time’ are only defined ONCE for all images of a respective band, this means that
                 - galapagos needs a 'uniform' survey setup or images to be normalized in this matter. 
                 - E.g. all images of a certain band must have the same zeropoint and exposure time (but different bands can be different)
                 - While a more complicated setup might be possible, it has not been implemented

IMPORTANT notes on the usage of multi-band setups:
- the images in all bands have to be micro-registered to each other and of the same setup, e.g. the same 'mosaic' has to be provided in all bands
  This is due to the nature of galapagos working mostly in pixel coordinates (other than during the source extractor block)
- the FIRST band defines the images on which SExtractor is carried out. This could e.g. be a COADDED image, to ensure deepest possible source extraction.
  It is NOT however used in the fitting process
- the first NORMAL band is somewhat important, too
  THIS is the band on which all deblending and masking decisions are taken. I would advice to use the deepest or highest-quality band for this purpose.
  avoid extreme bands here. Due to the nature of galfitm, the values at the edges of the wavelength range are potentially somewhat less secure, which
  could lead to bad deblending decisions.
- the other bands do not have to be in any specific order, they are ordered according to wavelength within galapagos.


images_[r,u,g,i,z,sex]
  - equivalent to images.gala in single-band surveys
  - format:
     For SExtractor:
          /path/to/image_sex_1_1.fits /path/to/weight_sex_1_1.fits tile1_1/ t1_1.
        the 3rd (output folder) and 4th (‘pre’ for file naming) parameters are only defined here
     For bands:
          /path/to/image_g_1_1.fits /path/to/weight_g_1_1.fits  (/path/to/rms_map_g_1_1.fits)
        As you can see, this now also includes the possibility to feed in a rms_map if the user choses to.
        If no rms map is given, galfit creates it;s own sigma map
        It is possible to give rms_map for some bands, and not for others, but the entire band has to be consistent,
        e.g. ALL g-band images need rms_maps, or none

  - Please note that the WEIGHT image does NOT get handed over to galfitm! 
       It is mostly used to create the mask image used in the fit  (and source detection in sex step)
  - the rms_map can be used for the purpose of sigma image in galfit
     if none is given, galfitm (for now) creates its own internal sigma map
     IF one is given, it has to follow the following setup:



#===========SEXTRACTOR SETUP===========
Introduced new setup to be able to use rms weighting in the SExtractor step.
B15 == ‘rms’ switches on this feature. Other than SExtractor, everything is unaffected.

EVERYTHING AFTERWARDS HAS BEEN RENAMED!! i=i-1


#===========STAMP SETUP AND SKYMAP CREATION=========
No changes, other than galapagos can use up to 4 CPUs for creating the stamp files and up to D18) cores for postage stamp cutting 
in order to speed up the process on large datasets.
Set D18) = 1 to switch this feature off (seems to be needed also for a single image in this step, see further down)


#===========SKY PREPARATION =====
NEW PARAMETERS
OLD D12) 100                       # fraction of sources to be treated first (in %; 5=5%)
HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT. This number actually had no effect anymore. It is easier and more precise to select target objects in other means.

EVERYTHING AFTERWARDS HAS BEEN RENAMED!! i=i-1

D18) 12                        # maximum number of parallel processes (see Barden 2012 for details)
On MY machines, it turns out that a number >16 is not possible. This comes down to IDL not being able to destroy the 'bridge' object 
that it uses for parallelization

To figure out whether this is true on your system, run (for any number D18):
   arr = objarr(D18)
   FOR i=0, D18-1 DO arr[i] = obj_new('IDL_IDLBridge')
   obj_destroy, arr

If IDL can do this, you can use the number D18
If it hangs itself, a smaller number is needed.
As I said, on my system, 16 turned out to be the highest possible (might change with IDL version?)

D19) 80                        # minimum distance (in arcseconds) to already blocked objects
                               # (to make sure that no faint object next to a very bright one is fit. standard value: D19)/3. )
The queuing system in the code changed. Galapagos fits objects from bright to faint. If the next bright object to do was too close 
to a currently fitted object, original Galapagos would WAIT for this object to finish, slowing down the overall fitting process.
galapagos-2 instead continues with the next brightest object and gets back to this object as soon as possible.
this means that some blocking radius around blocked object is needed (I had found that when using the same, very conservative 
radius D19) in densely populated fields blocked all objects in the survey, making a smaller radius necessary. 
If you prefer conservative, just set to high radius

D20) /path/to/target_objects   # optional list containing primary targets (format: RA DEC
                               # feature switched off when file does not exist, everything will be fit
D21) 1.0                       # search/correlation radius for the above list [arcsec]
This list lets you target specific objects (e.g. only the objects you have redshifts for)
the format of the file is easy and shown in the according example file (RA DEC, one line per object).
Advice would be to not only fit the objects of interest, but ADDITIONALLY objects within some radius (e.g. within D19) ) 
that are BRIGHTER than the object of interest. This ensures that the bright object is fit first and then dealt with properly 
when the interesting object will be done. We have not tried how much of an effect this scheme would have compared to only fitting \
the objects of interest directly, as it will be highly survey dependent.

This file also influences block C!!
postage stamps will only be cut for the objects in this file in order to use disk space. if you want postage stamps for all objects, 
disable this feature when running block C

If you are using a large target list on a large survey the source correlation in this step can take a VERY long time. In order to speed this up,
Galapagos creates a file in which is saves the correlation in a *sav file.
When you run the code again, it checks the creation dates of your input and that *sav file and only re-creates it when your input catalogue
changed (e.g. is newer than the *save file). To be sure to recreate it, simply delete the *sav file (with matching name to your input file) 
in your output folder.


#===========GALFIT SETUP=========== switched on at D00)
NEW PARAMETERS & RENAMED PARAMETERS!
E01) batch1               # filename for list of tiles in current batch (format: image)
had been taken out in previous versions of galapagos-2 although being present in original galapagos.
Has now been re-introduced in a much cleaner and easier manner in order to have several computers working on the same data
the file ‘batch1’ simply contains image names (SExtractor file names!!) that are to be dealt with. Only galaxies on these images are fit.
Galaxies on any other image are not being dealt with in this run of Galapagos-2.
By using different batch files, it is possible to run several machines and many cores on the same dataset but splitting up the survey into several areas
(See example on how to run Galapagos-2 on a large survey at the bottom of this file)

E04) /path/to/psf_r,/path/to/psf_u,/path/to/psf_g,/path/to/psf_i,/path/to/psf_z   # PSF filename including path (ensure same order as in A00)
original galapagos allowed ONE file at this point, e.g. it uses the SAME PSF for the entire survey.
This is unfeasible for
a) most ground-based surveys
b) multi-band surveys where the PSF obviously is different in different bands
Instead, galapagos-2 has 4 different ways to define PSFs
1) one CAN define individual PSF images fore each band here (separated by ',') if one wants to use the PSF for the entire area
2) one can define PSF files here, which contain information about the PSFs and where they should be used. 
This can be done in 3 ways (the code decides on the number of columns in these files which way is used. 
a) 2 columns: 1 PSF per time (format: tile_name psf_file), tile_name as in sextractor setup file)
b) 3 columns: closest PSF in RA&DEC (format: RA DEC psf_file). Note/Bug report: Due to the handling of the structure in this context, it is NOT possible to put a PSF exactly on RA/DEC 0/0 (this criterium detects ‘empty’ rows in a structure and I did not yet come up with a different solution for this)
c) 4 columns: defines a box in RA&DEC in which a PSF is used. If overlap, uses closest to box center (format: RA_min RA_max DEC_min DEC_max psf_file)

I would suggest version 2b) for most surveys.
PSFs have (yet) to be created beforehand, Galapagos-2 does NOT do this on-the-fly.
PSFs can be created by PSFEx, for example.

It SHOULD be able to use different setups in different bands, but this has not been well tested!

E11) 400                  # constraint max Re
(as information: as minimum radius 0.3 pixels is used as we do not expect smaller galaxies to be fitted. If you only believe a larger radius, 
please cut out in the output catalogue. The minimum size was introduced as at very small radii the fit iterations can take very long, due to 
oversampling issues (please read Barden et al. 2012 for details)

E14) 0.2                  #constraint min sersic index
E15) 8                    #constraint max sersic index
lets the USER define the allowed range in sersic index. 0.2-8 was hardcoded in the original version of galapagos, but some people argue 
that galaxies with n>8 are real, so these parameters hand over setting the constraints to the user.


E16) nice                 #nice the GALFIT process ("nice" = true) (If your IDL session is niced, the galfit is already niced automatically)
renamed, previously E14)

E17) 4.0                  #GALFIT version string. E.g. 2.0.3c  (this defines the input file format for the galfit start files.
renamed, previously E15)

E18) galfitm-0.1.3.1      # string used to identify running galfit processes in order to kill them after E19 minutes (string seen in 'top')
E19) 240                  # time (in minutes) after which galfit processes are killed
                          # feature switched off when time == 0 
Galapagos-2 has a feature to kill galfit processes when they have been running too long (as we have seen those to crash or produce garbage at some 
point anyway, but occupying CPUS for ages).
This is done by a combination of 'ps', 'grep' and 'kill', 
	ps -u YOU | grep E18
so E18 should be the string that the user can see when running 'top'.
Please notice: Using this feature will kill ALL galfit processes with this string by the user who runs galapagos (other users are un-affected), 
even the ones NOT started by Galapagos. Please use with care.
Switch this feature off way setting E19) == 0

E20) 0,0,9,2,2,0,0        # x,y,mag,re,n,AR,PA  order of Chebyshev polynomials in the individual parameters to be used in GALFIT
                          # 0 = constant over all wavelength, 1 = linear over wavelength,... #band-1 = free
                          # These are ADDITIONAL degrees of freedom, e.g. 0 STILL means, the parameters can be fit 
                          # (something which is decided by GALAPAGOS, not the user)
                          # This is DIFFERENT to the number that has to be given to GALFIT, in galfit = gala+1

This is the most important step for multi-band fitting.
As explained in Haeussler 2013, Vika 2013 and Bamford 2014 (in prep), the strength of GalfitM and the MegaMorph approach is that profiles
use all data simultaneously, but constrain the parameters over the different images in the different bands, hence utilising the wealth of the data.
The choice of degree of freedom used in the process is important. Too high degrees of freedom mean that the multi-band approach loses it’s advantages.
(e.g. using all parameters with degree of freedom equals number of bands would essentially carry out single-band fits on all images, just all at the same time)
This degree of freedom should probably be somewhat targeted at the science one wants to carry out, the galaxy sample in question and the images (bands) used.
- If all bands are close together, a real colour advantage to separate bulges and disks is probably not possible. One might only be interested in fitting
  a constant (with wavelength) profile to several images in order to take advantage of better signal-to-noise (e.g. ‘0’ would be the correct freedom to use above)
- Measuring colour gradients in large galaxies in single-sersic fits could require linear or second order polynomials to be fit (1 or 2)
- On large, nearby galaxies, using some degree of freedom even for individual galaxy components is probably possible.
- On faint(isn) distant galaxies, where B/D decomposition will be most desired, but most difficult, probably fitting a constant profile for each bulge and disk
  might be advisable, ignoring internal gradients of the component.
The degree of freedom used is down to the user and should be 
a) dealt with wisely
b) adapted to their needs
c) carefully tested

CAUTION IN THIS CONTEXT:
 - Galapagos-2 returns 2 sets of parameters for all values. 
         *_band, that give the values at the specified wavelengths, and 
         *_cheb, which give the parameters of the polynomials (*_cheb are the actual values used in the minimisation process). 
     While the *_band values can be used at all times, the *_cheb values only make sense when the degree of freedom is sufficiently small.
 - if the degree of freedom is small the polynomial can be used e.g. to derive ‘restframe’ values 
   (if you want to do this, ask me for an IDL routine that does this). if the degree of freedom is too high, 
 - if the degree of freedom is chosen to be equal or close to the number of images (as e.g. for magnitudes might be desired), the polynomial itself
   will oscillate between the defined wavelengths (‘Runge’s phenomenon). The *_band values will still be correct (for observed wavelengths), but the 
   polynomial should not be used to estimate restframe values.


E21) galfit               # output folder name for all galfit output files
creates an output folder in which to store all files related to the fits: 
galfit setup files
constraint files
mask images
galfit output files
This was introduced to keep all folders nice and clean.
original galapagos puts all files for each tile into the same folder, with big images and several bands this could produce 100s of 1000s of files.
They are now all stored in different folders (defined here and in A00) )

#===========B/D DECOMPOSITION SETUP===========
COMPLETE NEW BLOCK
Please not that B/D decomposition will NOT work when you use original galfit, due to the way the fits are set up in gala_bd_bridge.pro
The scripts needs information from the image header that original galfit does not store there. Re-writing this would be a major task.
If you want to carry out B/D decompositions, make sure you are using a galfitm version, even when using single-band data.

F00) execute                             # execute the B/D fitting block ('execute' = true). Mostly assumes that single sersic fitting (block E) is also or had previously been run
F01) 0,0,9,0,0,0,0                       # similar to E18 for BULGE (see README for details) 
F02) 0,0,9,0,-1,0,0                      # similar to E18 for DISK  (see README for details) 

should all be easy to understand with the above information.
Additionally:
If freedom of the sersic index is set to -1 (!), galapagos-2 uses:
n==1 (fixed) in case of disks
n==4 (fixed) in case of bulges
(more variation such that the user could set the fixed value is planned, but not yet implemented, turns out to be more complicated than I thought)

F03) bd1                                 # additional output label, e.g. output folder for galfit files: E21+'_'+F03 to keep files ordered
additional label for BD fit folders and files.
allows to carry out different fits (e.g. by using different F01 and F02 settings, without overwriting any fit files

F04) /path/to/target_objects             # optional list containing primary targets, can be different (a subset) of D21)
F05) 1.0                                 # search/correlation radius for the above list
F06) 18.0                                # additional magnitude limit (sersic fit, main band) down to which B/D will be done
the combination of these defines the sample to be fit with B/D fits
F04 CAN be different to D21, but it has to be a SUBSET of those (e.g. only the galaxies in question)
The B/D fit is set up using the SINGLE-SERSIC OUTPUT (!) file. This means that :
- neighbours are handled in the same way (in fact, they are held fixed at the profiles determined in the single-sersic fit)
- B/D will only be carried out for objects where a SS fit already exists

The starting values for the fits are also taken from the SS fits following this scheme (galapagos-2.0.6, subject to change):
(this could be changed by the user in 'gala_bd_bridge.pro)

Disk:
x & y : same as ss result
mag   : half the flux (mag+2.5*alog10(2))
re    : median(re_ss)*1.2 > 1 [px]
n     : median(n_ss) < 1.5  (or 1, when fixed value) (including variability with wavelength, see comments on E20 above!)
q     : q_ss
pa    : pa_ss

Bulge:
x & y : same as ss result
mag   : half the flux (mag+2.5*alog10(2))
re    : median(re_ss)*0.3 > 0.5 [px]
n     : median(n_ss) > 1.5  (or 1, when fixed value) (including variability with wavelength, see comments on E20 above!)
q     : q_ss
pa    : pa_ss

These values, especially for n and re, are still somewhat subject to testing, but they turned out to work quite nicely on nearby and 
artificially redshifted images as explained in Vika 2014, in prep.

While writing this README, I have noticed that technically different parameters are handled slightly differently (e.g. pa and q do not use MEDIAN(ss_values))
This might be corrected at some point, but has not yet been an issue due to the degrees of freedom we use (and we would advice to be used)

Please note that both the bulge and the disk are started using the SAME MAGNITUDES (and hence the same SED) !!
While some authors argue that this might be difficult for galfitm to deal with, it appears to us that it is not and bulge and disk can be separated quite well 
down to faint values. Again, if a user disagrees, the code can be changed in gala_bd_bridge.pro)


# ------ experimental and probably does not work for other users without code adaptation
F07) nHPC                                # switches to HPC mode ("HPC" = true), paths will be adapted (F08 and F09 become important)
F08) /path/to/HPC/output/folder          # alternative path for Supercomputer use.
F09) /path/to/data/, /path/to/data/HPC   # PSF filename correction (!). [1] is replaced by [2]

The HPC setup is VERY experimental and VERY targeted to the computer setup in Nottingham.
As the above B/D fits are entirely independent of each other in its current scheme, it is possible to have galapagos-2 only
write out the galfit start files. They can then be transferred to a HPC with many, many cores and carried out there very quickly.
saving overall computing time. If a user wants to use this feature, I am certain that he will have to change the galapagos code at 
this part to make it work for his setup. Please use with care and only if necessary. With using the 'batch' mode in E01, a speedup 
is possible by using several computers doing part of the data (as long as the y can see the same hard drive and an initial run has 
been carried out) and without using a HPC.

[on a different, but related, note: If a true HPC version on SINGLE BAND DATA (!) is desired, please contact Andreas Hiemer (andreas.hiemer@uibk.ac.at) who has 
transferred Galapagos-1 into a C-version with several additional features  (e.g. fitting Fourier modes). This only uses one band data, but can be fully used in 
a HPC environment, carrying out the fits much faster
Yes, we are planning to combine the 2 versions
No, this has not been done yet]

allows to read out only the single-sersic part of the fits

G01) execute      # execute catalogue combination block (read single-sersic & B/D), switches on G00 automatically
reads out both the single-sersic and B/D fits

Please be aware that if the output file already exists, it will be overwritten!! 
Don’t forget to rename your output catalogues, if you want to keep your old one.



***************** ADVISED WAY TO RUN GALAPAGOS IN A STABLE WAY (USING ‘SCREEN’) ***************
There are 2 issues that Galapagos, when you run it, is sensitive to:
  - loss of ssh connection 
  - Some internal tasks need a ‘screen’ to ‘print to’, even though no printout is delivered. Some of these are used in the IDL_BRIDGE,
    so their error messages are hidden from the user

A way to get around these problems is the following scheme:
  - ssh into your computer/server
  - create a VIRTUAL DISPLAY!!
    ‘nohup Xvfb :99 -screen scrn 800x600x16 &’   (or similar)
  - ‘screen’
  - ‘export DISPLAY=':99' ‘  (pipes all output to the virtual display)
  - make sure your IDL path is set correctly (e.g. via .bashrc, which is run when you start ‘screen’, or compile by hand)
  - ‘nice idl’   (this makes sure your Galapagos runs in the background, using only free CPU time
    It will not slow down other processes and users. (if you use nice idl, it’s a good idea to NOT nice the galfit as well, they will be 
    niced automatically, but not doubly)
  - start galapagos:
    galapagos, ‘/path/to/gala.setup_file’
  - Ctrl^A, Ctrl^D   puts the screen away. Get it back via ‘screen -r’

Your Galapagos does now run even when you close the ssh connection.

***************** ADVISED SCHEME WHEN RUNNING GALAPAGOS-2 ON LARGE DATASETS ***************
0) set your IDL path right for the galapagos run!!!!
1) cut all images into pieces
   due to the nature of the code, galapagos-2 runs several tasks over the entire input tile. The more objects there are, the longer it takes. 
   Smaller input tiles hence make the execution faster and should be preferred for large images.
   make sure there is enough overlap between tiles. Galapagos-2 will take care of objects that are detected in multiple tiles
   you can cut them e.g. using IDL:
	writefits, image_1_1.fits', large_tile[0:2000,0:2000], hdr
   or fits copy (part of cfitsio in Chien Pengs galfit package which most of you will have anyway)
        ./fitscopy large_tile.fits[0:2000,0:2000] image_1_1.fits    (or so)
       	
   I cut my images into 2000x2000 tiles with 500 pixels overlap. The overlap should be defined by the size of the largest object in the survey

2) set up your masks
   the weight images should be set ==0 for all pixels that should be masked out during the fit 
   (other than neighbouring objects, which galapagos-2 handles itself internally)
3) decide (and/or create):
   - the image that SExtractor will be run on
   - the mag_offset in A00 that galapagos needs to transfer SExtractor magnitudes into starting magnitudes, e.g. a median SED in comparison to the SExtractor values
   - which image/band you want the deblending decisions to be made on. Advice would be to use the 'deepest' band
4) create setup files
5) run blocks B and C (remember that C only cuts postage stamps for the objects defined in D21) using the ENTIRE LIST of images!!
   This creates a sextractor catalogue on which the entire rest of Galapagos is based. In order for the batch modes (below) to work, this has 
   to contain the ENTIRE list of objects. If you run SExtractor only over a subset of images, files will get overwritten and the batch modes
   will NOT work!
   You can run block B again with a different selection of objects later, but I would advice against running block B again! Ever!
   If you, do, all SExtractor numbers might change and hence all file names which could mean that Galapagos can not find the correct images
   to fit or that it confuses different galaxies. Once SExtractor is run, you should stick with what you have.
   Running the postage stamp cutting again is easy and possible in case you decide to fit a larger sample. Just change the target list 
   and run block C
6) create batch files (if needed)
7) run different setups (everything identical, other than the batch file in E01) on different machines
   Make sure they all see your galapagos run under the same path as defined in A01!!
   the batch mode restricts each run to primary objects on the defined input tiles, while knowing the entire object catalog 
   (e.g. making deblending decisions with full knowledge of the survey)
   For example, I have 4 computers with 12 cores each, each crunching through 1/4 of my tiles, but the limiting number of computers that 
   can be used is possibly only limited by the disk reading/writing speed.
8) Maybe run one more run without any batch files, to make sure you didn't forget any objects
9) run one last run with only reading out ALL results (although the batch mode does not technically affect this part of the code) 
10) do awesome science under full use of the MegaMorph fitting results!


***************** ADVISE WHEN RE-RUNNING GALAPAGOS, E.G. AFTER SERVER CRASH OR AFTER YOU’VE KILLED IT ***************
Galapagos saves and deletes several files during it’s run, e.g. to pass over information to the ‘bridge’ processes that take care of individual
galaxies.
When you re-run Galapagos these files need to be deleted. At no point when you start galapagos, should there be any *sav files in the GALFIT folders
In case you CTRL-C’d your galapagos, the same is true, as the *sav files will not be deleted by the code
In case you even killed running gal fits, please do the following:
- If you changed the setup and fits (e.g. postage stamp sizes or deblending decisions) might change, you need to delete all *obj and *sav files 
  in the /tile*/galfit/ folders
- If all your already finished fits will be fine as you didn’t change anything, you still need to find the *obj and *sav files of the objects 
  that you killed, e.g. using ls -tr *obj and ls -tr *gf.fits (to not delete the ones that successfully finished). Best is you delete 
  everything related to these objects (identified by their SExtractor number in all file names) so Galapagos thinks this object has not yet
  been tried and does it correctly. If you don’t delete the files (most importantlythe *obj file), Galapagos will think that the object has been
  started but the fit crashed. it will then accordingly only ‘read’ out the result (e.g. the sky values) and set flag_galfit == 1 in the output 
  catalogue

There is now a script called ‘clean_galfit_folder.pro; which you can use to do the above:
   - looks for SAV files in the galfit folders
   - removes the save file and the obj file of the same object

       VERSION HISTORY
*******************************************

V2.0.7
- D12 has been taken out of the input files as it had no effect in the code
  -> hence the main input file changes slightly, everything in block D and i>12 should be renamed to i=i-1
- Galapagos now works with original galfit again when using one-band data (and is very fast doing do!)
- the input has been cleaned up. All the tile subfolders are now defined in the sextractor file list
  The format is hence slightly different:
  For SExtractor:
       /path/to/image_sex_1_1.fits /path/to/weight_sex_1_1.fits tile1_1/ t1_1.
     the 3rd (output folder) and 4th (‘pre’ for file naming) parameters are only defined here
  For bands:
       /path/to/image_g_1_1.fits /path/to/weight_g_1_1.fits  (/path/to/rms_map_g_1_1.fits)
     As you can see, this now also includes the possibility to feed in a rms_map if the user choses to.
     If no rms map is given, galfit creates it;s own sigma map
     It is possible to give rms_map for some bands, and not for others, but the entire band has to be consistent,
      e.g. ALL g-band images need rms_maps, or none

v2.1.0
B15) RMS map now allowed for SExtractor

- MAP RMS: the FITS image specified by the WEIGHT IMAGE file name must contain a weightmapin units of absolute standard deviations (in ADUs per pixel).- MAP WEIGHT: the FITS image specified by the WEIGHT IMAGE file name must contain aweight-map in units of relative weights. The data are converted to variance units (by definitionvariance ∝ 1/weight), and scaled as for MAP VAR. MAP WEIGHT is the most commonlyused type of weight-map: a flat-field, for example, is generally a good approximation to aperfect weight-map.
